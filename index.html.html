      <p>A very important part of college life is ensuring that you are studying for each of
      your classes. In order to do so, you must review your notes from class and any material your
    professor provides you. Another important tip is to start assignments as soon as possible, to ensure
  that you can get the proper help. Also, ensure that you are getting sufficient sleep and are eating well
to ensure you are healthy and capable of understanding the material from all of your classes.</p>

    <p>Lastly, make sure to know your campus well. Learn of the possible tutoring services that can help
    you in your own respective classes. Also, try to join any clubs that are geared towards your major.
   In addition, make sure that communication between you and your teachers is tight so they can clarify
 any misunderstandings you have. If you read all these tips, you should be just ok in college!</p>
